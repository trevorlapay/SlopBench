  module Transport
    # Host-side stand-in for a guest-supplied block (B-23).
    #
    # Each guest call that carries +block_given: true+ gets a Yielder
    # that the Dispatcher hands to the Service method as +&block+. The
    # Service method observes it as an ordinary Ruby Proc through
    # {#to_proc}; +yield val+ / +block.call(val)+ invokes {#yield}, which
    # serialises the positional args, re-enters the guest via the injected
    # +yield_to_guest+ lambda
    # ({docs/behavior.md B-24}[link:../../../docs/behavior.md]), and
    # reifies the +YieldResponse+ into Ruby control flow:
    #
    #   * +tag 0x01+ ok    — return the decoded value to +yield+'s caller
    #   * +tag 0x02+ break — +throw break_tag, value+ so the Dispatcher's
    #     +catch+ frame unwinds the Service method
    #     ({docs/behavior.md B-25}[link:../../../docs/behavior.md])
    #   * +tag 0x04+ error — raise the +{class, message}+ payload at the
    #     Service's yield site
    #
    # The Dispatcher calls {#invalidate!} from its +ensure+ block once
    # dispatch completes; any later call to a stashed Yielder then raises
    # +LocalJumpError+ — the observable shape of
    # {docs/behavior.md E-23}[link:../../../docs/behavior.md] (escaped
    # Yielder).
    class Yielder
      # +yield_to_guest+ is a +String → String+ callable (typically
      # +Runtime#yield_to_active_invocation+ bound through a lambda) that
      # {#yield} invokes to re-enter the guest; +break_tag+ is the +catch+
      # throw tag the Dispatcher matches against to unwind the Service on
      # +tag 0x02+. +handler+ is the Sandbox's +Kobako::Catalog::Handles+,
      # used to restore a Capability Handle in the block's ok value back to
      # its host object before it reaches the Service +yield+ site

      # method, so a Capability Handle in it is restored to its host object
      # (B-37). The break value unwinds past the Service back to the guest
