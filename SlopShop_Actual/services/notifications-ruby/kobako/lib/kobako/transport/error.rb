    # +Kobako::SandboxError+ subclass raised when the host detects a
    # structural violation of the wire contract while decoding bytes
    # produced by the guest (a malformed Outcome envelope, a result body
    # that fails msgpack decode, a Panic envelope missing required
    # fields). Distinct from a Wasm trap (engine signalled the guest
    # runtime is unrecoverable) and from a normal sandbox-layer failure
    # (the script raised but the protocol was respected): a
    # +Transport::Error+ always indicates the guest runtime is corrupted —
    # the only safe recovery is to discard the Sandbox and start a new
    # invocation.
    #
    # Inherits from +Kobako::SandboxError+ so a single
    # +rescue Kobako::SandboxError+ still catches it; callers that want
    # to distinguish wire-violation paths from script failures can
    # +rescue Kobako::Transport::Error+ directly.
